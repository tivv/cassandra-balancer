This is small utility to balance cassandra cluster. It uses nodetool, so you need to have it available in path. At the same time, it needs no special classpath.
It takes single argument - host name of any node in your cluster. 
Cluster should be all up and in normal state, other wise tool will exit with non-0 exit code.
At single run it will balance single node.
